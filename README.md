# RustBase

**RustBase** is a self-hosted backend platform built in Rust, designed to give developers the flexibility of Firebase or Supabase while keeping **full control over your cloud/deployment environment**. It provides common backend features out-of-the-box while allowing you to build your own UI and custom business logic on top.
